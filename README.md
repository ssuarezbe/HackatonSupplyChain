## Problem Statement


Modern supply chains depend on the effective and precise orchestration between producers, distributors, retailers, customers, insurance companies, banks, and other actors. Moreover, these actors are distributed across different geographies and legalizations. This diversity creates a data interoperability problem that makes the task of getting a holistic supply-chain Observability an impossible task without a common language. To solve this problem, we propose the creation of an Open Data Exchange and Observability platform based on [GS1 Global Data Model](https://www.gs1.org/standards/gs1-global-data-model) , [GS1 GDSN](https://www.gs1.org/standards/gdsn), [x-road](https://x-road.global/), and [other GS1 standards](https://www.gs1.org/standards/standards-overview).
