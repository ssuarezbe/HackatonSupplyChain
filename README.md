# Summary

* Idea Title: GS1 Supply-Chain Observability Initiative
* Problem Statement: What is the specific problem? 
* Approach: How will you solve it? Problem by technology (your solution)? 
* Overview with a diagram: Share your solutions/prototype mock image & business model with a diagram

## Problem Statement

 are based on parterniship between differenet actors across different industries, 

Modern supply chains depend on effective orchestration between different producers, distributors, reatailers ,customers, insurance companies, banks and other actors distributed across the world. 


Each actor have is own data standard
Each actor have is own data systems
Can not get full picture of the supply chain
Can not detect possible bottlenecks because is do not have the full picture of the supply chain
Integration is costyl because is requires an specific implementation with each party

Actor across the world
different industries
different countries
different laws
different supply chains
different data standards

How can standards and technology empower shorter supply chains to improve versatility and resilience? 
How can standardized location data be leveraged in shortened and diversified supply chains to provide better traceability and assurances of authenticity? 
How can GS1 standards be leveraged in circular use cases (refurbishment, remanufacturing, recommerce, etc.) for more localized supply chains to provide better traceability and assurances of authenticity?
